### AI for bias detection

We have used Airtable to maintain the content database and then integrated ChatGPT for bias detection and open content moderation.
We have used Datafetcher, an extension, to connect the airtable database and Chatgpt.
We have also automated some processes using airtable. 
For example: Sending out mails after bias check has been done indicating the presence or absence of bias
              or posting the tweet directly on on twitter page if it doesn't have any bias

### How to use Airtable for bias checking

  It is pretty simple. Go into the extensions and once you see Data Fetcher, run the module and it'll give you the yes or no in the 'Biased or not' coloumn of the grid view.
  To understand how the extension works, check out the formulas in the coloumn' Biased or not' and explore Datafetcher
