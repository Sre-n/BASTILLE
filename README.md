### AI for bias detection

We have used Airtable to maintain the content database and then integrated ChatGPT for boas detection and open content moderation.
We have used Datafetcher, an extension, to connect the airtable database and Chatgpt.
We have also automated some of the processes using airtable. 
For example: Sending out mails after bias check has been done indicating the presence or absence of bias
              or posting the tweet directly on on twitter oage if it doesn't have any bias
